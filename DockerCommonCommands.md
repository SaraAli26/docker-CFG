# Common Docker Commands

In this file, you'll find some of the commands that you might use, along with explanations for each:

**Note**:
Whenever you find ```<image_name>``` or ```<container_id>``` know that you need to change it with the corresponding name or id, and the ```<>``` will be removed. 

- **docker pull <image_name>**: 
  This command downloads a Docker image from a registry (like Docker Hub) to your local machine. For example, `docker pull mysql` will fetch the latest MySQL image.

- **docker images**: 
  This command lists all the Docker images that are currently stored on your local machine, showing the repository, tag, and image ID.

- **docker build -t <image_name> .**: 
  This command creates a Docker image from a Dockerfile located in the current directory. The `-t` flag allows you to specify a name for the image. For example, `docker build -t library-service .` will build the image named `library-service`.

- **docker run <image_name>**: 
  This command creates and starts a container from the specified image. For example, `docker run mysql` will start a new MySQL container.

- **docker-compose up**: 
  This command starts all the services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. It creates the containers based on the configurations specified in the file.

- **docker ps**: 
  This command lists all running containers, showing their container ID, names, status, and ports.

- **docker stop <container_id>**: 
  This command stops a running container specified by its container ID. For example, `docker stop abc123` will stop the container with the ID `abc123`.

- **docker rm <container_id>**: 
  This command removes a stopped container from your local machine. For example, `docker rm abc123` will delete the container with the ID `abc123`.

- **docker rmi <image_name>**: 
  This command removes a Docker image from your local machine. For example, `docker rmi library-service` will delete the image named `library-service`.

- **docker logs <container_id>**: 
  This command retrieves the logs from a specified container, allowing you to see the output and error messages generated by the container.
