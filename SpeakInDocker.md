# Speak in Docker - and other realted concepts

## Docker
Docker is a platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It enables applications to run consistently across various computing environments.

## Docker Engine
The Docker Engine is the core component of Docker. It is a client-server application that allows you to create and manage Docker containers.

## Docker Desktop
Docker Desktop is a user-friendly application that provides an easy way to manage Docker on your local machine. It includes the Docker Engine, a graphical interface, and a CLI for building and running containers. Docker Desktop is available for Windows and macOS.

## Image
An image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Images are read-only and can be used to create containers.

## Container
A container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. It includes the application and its dependencies but runs in isolation from the host system. Containers are lightweight and share the OS kernel, making them faster and more efficient than traditional virtual machines.

So, Docker images and containers are fundamental concepts in Docker's architecture. An image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, such as code, libraries, and dependencies. It serves as the blueprint for creating containers. A container, on the other hand, is a running instance of an image. It encapsulates the application environment and its runtime, allowing it to execute in isolation. While an image remains static and can be shared, a container is dynamic and can be started, stopped, and modified during its lifecycle. Thus, images are the source from which containers are instantiated, highlighting their interdependent relationship.

## CMD or Terminal
The CMD or terminal is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. In the context of Docker, you can use the terminal to execute Docker commands for managing images and containers. You can either use your PC terminal or the terminal integrated into IntelliJ. If you are using your PC terminal, make sure that you are in the correct directory using the commands ```cd``` and ```cd..``` (according to your operating system).

## Containerizing
Containerizing is the process of packaging an application and its dependencies into a Docker container. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, whether it's on a developer's machine, in a test environment, or in production.

## Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a script that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image to use, copies the application files, installs dependencies, and defines how the application should run. Dockerfiles allow for automated image creation and configuration.

## Volume
Volumes are a way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They enable data to exist independently of containers, ensuring that it remains available even if the container is removed. This is useful for databases and other stateful applications.

## docker-compose.yml
The `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to specify the services, networks, and volumes for your application in a simple YAML format. With Docker Compose, you can manage the entire lifecycle of your application, including building images, starting containers, and managing dependencies between services.
